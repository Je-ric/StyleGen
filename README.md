## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** — Base structure
- **Tailwind CSS** — Primary styling framework
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — Logic for live generation and preview

## 💡 How It Works

1. Choose a generator (e.g., Border, Shadow, Filter).  
2. Adjust the sliders, color pickers, or inputs to customize your style.  
3. Switch between **CSS** and **Tailwind** tabs in the code section.  
4. Copy your generated style and use it directly in your project.

## Note:

I will continuously improve this and will apply and implement tailwind utilities.
